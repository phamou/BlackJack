# BlackJack
This BlackJack game simulation attempts at linking .h files as well as linking different classes with constructors into a main file:

* blackjack.h contains all declarations of the classes needed
* blackjack.cpp contains the definition and implementation of the classesâ€™ methods
* main.cpp contains only the main() function.
